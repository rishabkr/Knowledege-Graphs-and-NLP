# Knowledege-Graphs-and-NLP
A simple triple based knowledge graph construction by extracting sentence structures and properties.

Uses spacy to extract the dependency tree and the corresponding attribute tokens for each word, then uses their 
grammatical properties to create nodes and edge relationships to create a knowledge graph which has similar
related topics closeby to each other.
The dataset used is a collection of ~4.5k random WIKIPEDIA sentences. The dataset was taken from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/ved1104/wiki-sentences">kaggle.</a>
